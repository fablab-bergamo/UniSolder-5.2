My intention was to build the most universal soldering controller I can think of. It can drive any low voltage (upto 24V) iron with thermocouple or resistive sensor, in series with the heater, or separate.

### A short list of features:
- power: 12-24V, AC or DC (24V 6A toroidal transformer is the best possible power source)
- automatic 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 power selection, so only simple single winding 24V transformer can drive all the instruments, from the smallest JBC Nano, to the largest JBC C245.
- 2 separate heater control channels
- 2 independent sensor inputs
- current source on any sensor input 3uA - 12mA, with 2 bands (x1, x16) and 256 steps per band
- flexible differential amplifier input selection
- amplifier gain from 0 to 750 in 256 steps
- negative offset selection in 1024 steps
- resistive instrument identification (upto 625 different instruments can be identified by 2 resistors in the connector)
- polynomial floating point voltage/resistance to temperature calculation
- wave shaping to filter out the inductive peaks from series sensor signal
- PID control with power limit
- isolated USB port for firmware updates and live data
- 128x64 OLED display with rich user interface.

### Tested so far with:
- HAKKO T12/T15 (series TC)
- HAKKO FX8801 (PTC)
- PACE TD100 (series TC, the controller also uses the cold junction sensor in the iron's handle)
- PACE TD200 (series TC, the controller also uses the cold junction sensor in the iron's handle)
- JBC C245 (series or separate TC, depends on connection)
- JBC C210 (series TC)
- JBC Microtweezers (PA120/AN120, 2 separate heaters, each with series TC)
- JBC C105/C115 (series TC)
- JBC Nanotweezers (NP115/AN115/NP105/NP105-B, 2 separate heaters, each with series TC)
- WELLER WSP80 (PTC) (This iron was sent to me by a reader of the thread for a previous version of the controller. Thanks, Jaroslaw)
- WELLER WMRT (2 separate heaters, each with separate TC)
- ERSA RT80 (series PTC/heater resistance)
- various chinese cheap irons with separate TC

## The calibration procedure
- Connect a resistor with well known resistance (0.1%) of around 10ohm between SENSEA and Vout1-
- Go to "CALIBRATION" submenu
- Adjust the calibration trimmer until you get value of "R" as close as possible to the resistance of the resistor, multiplied by 100 (1000 for 10ohm resistor).
- Optionally, press and hold center button for 3+ seconds an release it - the "currect" parameter should now show "1 128" instead of "0 128" it was showing so far
- Connect the same resistor to SENSEB and Vout1-. The Value of "R" should be da same or very close to value shown 2 steps above. If there is a significant difference, there is a problem either with current sources or 0.1% resistors they must be made with.
